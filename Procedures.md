# Project 3 - Procedures
In this third project should you be working with what have been discussed regarding aync programming and code first databases.

You should work in the group during the second half of the lecture.

Your group going to present (a mini-presentation) the key points of you solution. And the rest of the class will give a points for the solution.

You need:

* One and only one, computer
* A stopwatch
* A yellow hat for the spy
* A green hat for the driver

Work with mob programming, one driver, 15 min per driver, driver wears a green hat, spy wears an yellow hat.

Everybody in the group is driver on turn. The last thing the drives does before leaving the keyboard to the next driver is to perform a commit and push of the code to GitHub. The comment should have the following comment "Driver @Github-username" eg. "Driver @skjohansen"

**Deadline** is 2020-03-30 at 09:00, with presentation Monday morning (30th of march).

## Team

The team consist of 3 to 4 persons, with the following roles:

- **Driver**, the one sitting in front of the computer, and the only one using the keyboard and mouse
- **Timekeeper**, has a stopwatch and makes sure the team switch places as close to 10 min as possible and that the spy only spies the allowed time
- **Co-drivers** everybody is in theory co-drivers and helps the driver. The term is taken from Rally where the co-driver keeps track on the track and the driver is responsible of steering the car.

The team rotate roles every 10 minutes.

The timing is important as the team will retrieve penalty points for late or early rotation (measured on the git commit/push).

You can use Visual Studio Live to support this.

## Code review

Each team have two review teams.

Make sure to use code reviews. The best is to collect code reviews by functionality. So when you have some functionality ready send it for code review to the other two teams.

When your team receives a code review make sure to perform is as soon as possible, but you should not throw everything you are working on just to do the review.

## Mini-presentation of the project

On Monday 30th of march 9:00, will each group do a mini presentation. You should long before the presentation have made decision in the group who is going to do the talking.

Be sharp you only have **5 min**.

The rest of class will give a vote, scale is 1-5, this vote is placed into the hat of the group.

### When voting

Remember to write the group you are voting on and your own group on the voting paper. Otherwise is the vote considered invalid.

Look for the following in the presentation:

- Code
- Tests
- Patterns
- Readiness
- Presentation

- Timing

## Points

This project is part of the overall evaluation of all students. This is done by collecting point. You and you team will get points for the following:

- Presentation, team-point
- A driver check-in, personal-point
- A vote, team-point
- Code reviews, team-point for creating the review and for performing the review.
- Time off switching, gives negative points, team-point.
